I've got a chnge of my heart.

It's time to write some data structures and algorithms in a **tdd** way.

## Data structures:

### Linked Lists:
Those are supposed to implement the following methods, and only statisfying all of them will count as a success in the table:
- Create a new list
- Insert a value at the beginning
- Insert a value at the end
- Insert a value at specific index
- Update a vaule at specific index
- Delete the first value and return it
- Delete the last value and return it
- Delete a value at specific index and return it
- Is empty check
- Get a value form given index
- Get the first value
- Get the last value
- **There will be more added later**

### TODO:
There has to be a cli or graphical interface.
