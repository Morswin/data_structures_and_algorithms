I've got a chnge of my heart.

It's time to write some data structures and algorithms in a **tdd** way.

## Data structures:

### Linked Lists:
Those are supposed to implement the following methods, and only statisfying all of them will count as a success in the table:

|Name|C++|JS|Python|Rust|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Array-based Linked List|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Array-based Linked List with loop|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Array-based Double Linked List|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Node-based Linked List|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Node-based Linked List with loop|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Node-based Double Linked List|❌|❌|❌|❌|

### Other:

|Tree|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Graph|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Stack|❌|❌|❌|❌|

|Heap|❌|❌|❌|❌|

## Algorithms:

### TODO:
There has to be a cli or graphical interface.
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] Graphical interface
