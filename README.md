I've got a chnge of my heart.

It's time to write some data structures and algorithms in a **tdd** way.

First of all, there must be a clear list of what should I try to implement.
- [ ] List of things to implement
And a table which summarizes what have been already done and what's not.
- [ ] Table with summary
And lastly, there has to be a cli or graphical interface.
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] Graphical interface

For starters I'll try to include those 4 languages. But I don't know yet in what order I will approach this.
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Python
- [ ] JS
- [ ] Rust
